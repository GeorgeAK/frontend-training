HTML Favicon
 A favicon is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.
 https://www.favicon.cc Use this website to create your own favicon
 To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your 
webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this 
folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico"
 Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:
 Favicon file format/extension: ico, png, gif, jpeg, svg
 Example:
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
 <title>My Page Title</title>
 <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/images/favicon.ico">
 </head>
 <body>
 <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
